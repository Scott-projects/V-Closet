# V-Closet

## Purpose
As technology continues to advance, we see new and innovative solutions emerging to tackle various problems. One of the challenges that many people face is finding the perfect outfit to wear. Whether it's for a special occasion or everyday wear, it can be a struggle to find clothes that fit our style and preferences. Additionally, fashion trends are constantly changing, and it can be expensive to keep up with the latest styles. Closet organization applications currently exist to help users control their wardrobe and plan their outfits. These applications, though, focus mainly on styling, recycling, and finding outfit inspirations. So far, a wardrobe organizer that plans outfits in accordance to weather data does not exist.

In creating V-Closet, we gathered information on various geolocation and weather APIs that would support our intended use. We incorporated these APIs in our project to provide a unique service that we believe many users will benefit from.By automating daily outfits and ensuring its compliance with forecasted weather conditions, V-closet can help eliminate the difficulty of making outfit decisions, promote the reuse and recycling of clothes, and bring user the confidence of dressing correctly for any occasion, at any time, and during any type of weather.

To address these challenges, we have developed V-Closet, an online virtual wardrobe that provides users with a range of features to make their fashion choices easier and more affordable. V-Closet allows users to create an account and upload pictures of their clothing items, which can be categorized by type, color, or any other criteria. This provides users with a convenient and organized way to keep track of their wardrobe and easily find specific items when needed.
One of the standout features of V-Closet is the personalized recommendations it provides based on the weather. By using up-to-date weather information, V-Closet can suggest outfits that are appropriate for different weather conditions, such as rain, cold, or hot weather. This helps users to stay comfortable and stylish, regardless of the weather outside.

In addition to personalized recommendations, V-Closet also functions as a marketplace, allowing users to buy, sell, and trade clothing items with other users. This feature provides users with a cost-effective way to expand their wardrobe and experiment with new styles without having to spend a lot of money on new clothes. With V-Closet, users can explore a wide range of fashion options and find unique pieces that they may not have been able to find otherwise.

Overall, V-Closet provides users with a comprehensive solution for managing their wardrobe, finding new styles, and staying on top of fashion trends. By combining personalized recommendations, weather updates, and marketplace functionality, V-Closet is a must-have tool for anyone looking to elevate their fashion game. The following block diagram in Figure 1 showcases the main features of our system.

## How to deploy or build our application

Users wishing to set up their V-Closet website will have to first set up a firebase project of their own. Go to the Firebase Console website: https://console.firebase.google.com/ and sign in to your Google account or create a new one. Click on the "Add project" button to create a new Firebase project. Enter a project name and select your country/region from the drop-down menu.
Click on the "Create project" button to create your project. Once your project is created, you will be taken to the Firebase project dashboard. From the dashboard, you can choose which Firebase services you want to use for your project. For setting up V-Closet, you will need to enable Authentication, Firestore, Storage, and Hosting. Firebase will walk you through setting each of these up. The access rules for Firestore and Storage will need to be set up as well. Figures 4 and 5 show what the rules should look like for Firestore and Storage respectively.

After you have finished setting up the firebase project and each required service, head to the V-Closet github at https://github.com/Scott-projects/V-Closet. Download a zip of the main branch by clicking the green “< > Code” button, and then extract it. Next. the IDE will need to be set up. Download visual studio code at https://code.visualstudio.com/ and node.js at https://nodejs.org/en. Open the extracted folder in Visual Studio Code and run the command ‘npm install’ in the terminal. While the necessary packages are being installed, open the firebase.js file and change the firebase config object so that it contains your api key and other relevant information instead of ours. This can be found in your Firebase project’s settings and is shown in figure 6.

Finally, we can start to deploy the project. First off, run the command ‘npm run build’. This will create a build folder which will be the code that should be deployed to hosting. Next, login and initialize the Visual Studio Code project folder as a Firebase project. Type the command ‘firebase login’ to login to your google account associated with your Firebase project. Next, type the command ‘firebase init’. This will take you through the initialization process. Make sure you check all the necessary services. The deploy directory should be specified as the “build” folder. Finally, run the command ‘firebase deploy’ to have firebase host the build that was created in the build folder. 

## Repo Structure

The main branch is where the lattest version of V-Closet is kept. The Documentation Folder holds all documentation for this project. This includes an extensive paper  detailing the system in its entirely as well as several diagrams showcasing the system. Landing-page-prototype holds all of the code for our project. This includes the source code, the build, node modules, and other configuration files.
