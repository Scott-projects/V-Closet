# V-Closet

##Purpose

As technology continues to advance, we see new and innovative solutions emerging to tackle various problems. One of the challenges that many people face is finding the perfect outfit to wear. Whether it's for a special occasion or everyday wear, it can be a struggle to find clothes that fit our style and preferences. Additionally, fashion trends are constantly changing, and it can be expensive to keep up with the latest styles. Closet organization applications currently exist to help users control their wardrobe and plan their outfits. These applications, though, focus mainly on styling, recycling, and finding outfit inspirations. So far, a wardrobe organizer that plans outfits in accordance to weather data does not exist.
In creating V-Closet, we gathered information on various geolocation and weather APIs that would support our intended use. We incorporated these APIs in our project to provide a unique service that we believe many users will benefit from.By automating daily outfits and ensuring its compliance with forecasted weather conditions, V-closet can help eliminate the difficulty of making outfit decisions, promote the reuse and recycling of clothes, and bring user the confidence of dressing correctly for any occasion, at any time, and during any type of weather.
To address these challenges, we have developed V-Closet, an online virtual wardrobe that provides users with a range of features to make their fashion choices easier and more affordable. V-Closet allows users to create an account and upload pictures of their clothing items, which can be categorized by type, color, or any other criteria. This provides users with a convenient and organized way to keep track of their wardrobe and easily find specific items when needed.
One of the standout features of V-Closet is the personalized recommendations it provides based on the weather. By using up-to-date weather information, V-Closet can suggest outfits that are appropriate for different weather conditions, such as rain, cold, or hot weather. This helps users to stay comfortable and stylish, regardless of the weather outside.
In addition to personalized recommendations, V-Closet also functions as a marketplace, allowing users to buy, sell, and trade clothing items with other users. This feature provides users with a cost-effective way to expand their wardrobe and experiment with new styles without having to spend a lot of money on new clothes. With V-Closet, users can explore a wide range of fashion options and find unique pieces that they may not have been able to find otherwise.
Overall, V-Closet provides users with a comprehensive solution for managing their wardrobe, finding new styles, and staying on top of fashion trends. By combining personalized recommendations, weather updates, and marketplace functionality, V-Closet is a must-have tool for anyone looking to elevate their fashion game. The following block diagram in Figure 1 showcases the main features of our system.
